Quicko Connect uses a two-tiered authentication system to secure API interactions and ensure that only authorised users can access sensitive data:

1. **API User Access Token**: Required to interact with OAuth APIs. This token authenticates your application as a trusted client.
2. **Resource Owner Access Token**: Used to authenticate requests to Open APIs. This token represents the user's consent and is obtained through the OAuth flow.

## Acquiring API User Access Token

To use Quicko's OAuth APIs, you need an API User Access Token:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authentication Endpoint">
    Call the `/authenticate` endpoint with your API credentials (key and secret).

  <Accordion title="Keep Credentials Secure" icon="shield-check" defaultOpen>
    Store your API keys and secrets securely and never expose them in public repositories or client-side code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use HTTPS" icon="lock">
    Ensure all API requests are made over HTTPS to protect data in transit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle Errors Gracefully" icon="triangle-alert">
    Implement error handling for authentication failures and other API errors.
