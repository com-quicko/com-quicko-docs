## Authorization

<Info>
  Open APIs require an `Authorization` header with the JWT access token obtained through the OAuth flow.
</Info>

All Open API requests must include two headers:

| Header | Description | Required |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `Authorization` | Resource Owner's JWT access token (obtained via OAuth) | Yes |
| `x-api-key` | Your API User Key (provided during onboarding) | Yes |

### Example Request

```bash cURL
curl https://api.quicko.com/income-tax/tax-payer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMi..." \
  -H "x-api-key: key_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.get('https://api.quicko.com/income-tax/tax-payer', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMi...',
    'x-api-key': 'key_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  }
});

console.log(response.data);
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMi...',
    'x-api-key': 'key_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.quicko.com/income-tax/tax-payer',
    headers=headers
)

print(response.json())
```

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Data Privacy & Security

<Warning>
  **Important:** User data obtained through Open APIs is sensitive personal and financial information. You must:
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtain Explicit Consent">
    Always obtain explicit user consent before accessing their data through the OAuth flow.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit">
    Use industry-standard encryption (AES-256, TLS 1.2+) for storing and transmitting data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implement Access Controls">
    Restrict data access to only authorized personnel and systems. Use role-based access control (RBAC).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Comply with Regulations">
    Ensure compliance with:
    - Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023
    - GDPR (for EU users)
    - Other applicable data protection laws
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Provide User Rights">
    Allow users to:
    - View what data you've accessed
    - Revoke access at any time
    - Request data deletion
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Regular Security Audits">
    Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing of your integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rate Limiting

<Note>
  API rate limits ensure fair usage and system stability. Current limits are subject to your service agreement.
</Note>

If you exceed rate limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff and retry logic in your application.

## Error Handling

Open APIs return standard HTTP status codes and error responses:

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or expired token |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "transaction_id": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
  "timestamp": 1699351274048,
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid or expired access token",
    "type": "authentication_error"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Always check the `transaction_id` in responses. This helps Quicko support team debug issues quickly if you encounter problems.
