    **OAuth Flow Steps:**
    1. Obtain API User Access Token via `/authenticate` endpoint
    2. Initialize OAuth authorization flow
    3. User grants consent through authorization endpoint
    4. Receive Resource Owner Access Token
    5. Use token for Open API requests

    **Use Cases:**
    - Custom UI implementations
    - Server-side integrations
    - Advanced workflow customization
    - Multi-platform integrations
  </Accordion>

    Integrate directly with Quicko Connect APIs for complete control over user experience and data flow. Perfect for advanced use cases requiring custom implementations.

    **Available APIs:**
    - User management endpoints
    - Tax filing endpoints
    - Tax computation APIs
    - Advisory services APIs
    - Event webhooks

    **Requirements:**
    - Valid API credentials (key and secret)
    - OAuth flow implementation
    - User consent management
    - Secure token storage
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration Architecture

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Event-Driven System" icon="zap" defaultOpen>
    Quicko Connect uses an event-driven architecture that keeps your platform informed about user actions and journey progress. All events are shared transparently with channel partners.

    **Event Types:**
    - User journey milestones
    - Tax filing status updates
    - Payment transactions
    - Document uploads
    - User consent changes

    **Implementation:**
    - Register event listeners in your app
    - Handle events asynchronously
    - Update UI based on event data
    - Track user journey progress
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Privacy & Consent" icon="shield-check">
    Privacy and user consent are fundamental to Quicko Connect integrations. All data access and actions require explicit user consent, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

    **Consent Management:**
    - Explicit consent prompts
    - Granular permission controls
    - Consent revocation support
    - Transparent data usage policies

    **Best Practices:**
    - Request consent at appropriate times
    - Explain data usage clearly
    - Provide easy opt-out mechanisms
    - Maintain consent records
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token Management" icon="lock">
    Proper token management is crucial for secure integrations. Understand how to acquire, store, and refresh access tokens throughout your application lifecycle.

    **Token Types:**
    - **API User Access Token**: Authenticates your application
    - **Resource Owner Access Token**: Represents user consent

    **Security Practices:**
    - Store tokens securely (never in client-side code)
    - Implement token refresh mechanisms
    - Use HTTPS for all API requests
    - Handle token expiration gracefully
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Start
