  Solving taxes is intricate and often requires comprehensive user interaction. Our web integration ensures that your users access a full-fledged, tax-focused environment, tailored to handle these complexities efficiently. By redirecting users to the Quicko's web app, they can complete their tax journey in a setting specifically designed for this purpose, rather than within the confines of a channel partner's app which may not be optimized for such tasks.

## Integration Options

Quicko offers two distinct pathways for web integration: Lite Integration and Advanced Integration. Each path caters to different needs and capabilities of our channel partners.
