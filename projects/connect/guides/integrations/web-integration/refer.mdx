## Workflow Overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Building the Redirect URL">
    The redirect URL would look like:

    ```
    https://it.quicko.com?affiliate_id={{YOUR_AFFILIATE_ID}}
    ```

    <Card
      title="Affiliate ID"
      icon="id"
    >
      An `affiliate_id` helps Quicko attribute a user conversion to you. You can also use your affiliate dashboard to keep track of all the conversions and transactions performed by the users attributed to you. To get started, head over to Clique.
