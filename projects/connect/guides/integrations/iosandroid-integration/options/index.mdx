## Overview

The `Options` object provides a flexible mechanism for configuring the behavior of the Quicko Connect SDK. This configuration object allows you to specify various options that can tailor the SDK's functionality to meet specific requirements of your application. The object is completely optional; omitting it will invoke the SDK's default behavior.

## Structure

Each field is optional, and default settings are used if specific options are not provided. Below is a detailed description of each available option:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. intent" icon="target" defaultOpen>
    Specifies the purpose of using the SDK.

    **Values**: `connect` | `refer`

    <Columns cols={2}>
      <Card

        icon="link"
      >
        Specifies the intent to fully integrate into Quicko's ecosystem. It enables consent-based access to user events and Open API functionalities. This option is ideal for applications requiring deeper integration with Quicko's capabilities, such as retrieving user-specific data or actions through the API, which can enhance the application's functionality and user experience.

      <Card
        title="refer"
        icon="arrow-right"
      >
        Specifies an intent to use the SDK for a more specific and limited purpose — to assist users in solving their tax-related issues without the need for deep integration into the Quicko ecosystem. SDK operates in a mode that does not involve event callbacks, nor does it provide access to the Open API. This option is tailored for scenarios with the primary goal is to facilitate a straightforward and effortless integration.
