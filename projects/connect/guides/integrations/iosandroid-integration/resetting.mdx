description: "Clear persisted user session data from the SDK"

The SDK has been designed to provide a seamless and unified experience for the end users. After a user has been authenticated successfully, the SDK will persist the user session information. This ensures that users won't need to reauthenticate during subsequent interactions, making the experience smoother.

However, there could be scenarios where it's necessary to remove or clear the persisted user session data from the client side. For instance, if a user logs out or if there's a need to start a fresh session.

## `reset()` Method

To facilitate this, the SDK provides the `reset()` method.

  <Tab title="Java">
    ```java
    QuickoSDK.INSTANCE.reset();
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    QuickoSDK.reset()
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Swift">
    ```swift
    QuickoSDK.instance.reset()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

By invoking this method, developers can effectively clear all the data that the SDK persisted on the client end. This includes user session information, any cached data, and other related parameters.

## Sample Use Cases

<Card
  title="User Logout"
  icon="log-out"
>
  When a user logs out of your application, you can call the `reset()` method to ensure that their session and related data are wiped clean.
</Card>

<Card
  title="Privacy Mode"
  icon="shield"
>
  If your platform has a privacy mode or similar feature, where data persistence isn't desired, you can use the `reset()` method to clear session data whenever needed.
</Card>

<Card
  title="Error Recovery"
  icon="refresh-cw"
>
  In rare cases, if there are session-related issues or anomalies, invoking the `reset()` method can serve as a first step in troubleshooting, ensuring a clean slate.
