## Overview

This guide is designed to provide an overview of the notification system employed by us to keep users informed about their transactions. By understanding the types of notifications sent by us, Channel Partners can develop complementary communication strategies to enhance user engagement and ensure a seamless experience.

## Types of Notifications from Quicko

We employ a multi-channel notification strategy to keep users informed about their activity. These notifications are automatic and designed to provide timely updates. Here's a breakdown of the types of notifications users can expect:

  These serve as immediate acknowledgment of the transaction's initiation, completion or failure. Some examples of such transactions are present in the Event Directory.

  icon="shield-alert"
>
  For security-related events, such as login attempts from new devices or locations, password changes, or other security settings modifications, users receive alerts. These are crucial for maintaining the integrity of user accounts and for prompt action in case of unauthorized access.
