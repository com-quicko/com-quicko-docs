Quicko Tools are **free to use** for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. There are no usage fees, API limits, or hidden costs associated with embedding our tools into your platform.

## Attribution Requirement

While Quicko Tools are free, **attribution is required**. We believe in the philosophy of giving credit where it's due. By providing proper attribution:

- You help others discover these tools
- You support the ecosystem of free, high-quality tax utilities
- You acknowledge the expertise and effort behind building these tools

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Attribution is not just recommended—it is **required** when using Quicko Tools. The attribution must be visible to end users.

## Attribution Guidelines

When embedding Quicko Tools, you must include a visible attribution that links back to Quicko. The attribution should be:

1. **Visible** – Easily noticeable to users
2. **Proximate** – Near the embedded tool
3. **Linked** – Hyperlinked to `https://quicko.com`

## Attribution Snippets

Add attribution near your embedded tool. Here are ready-to-use snippets:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="HTML">
    ```html
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px; color: #666; margin-top: 16px;">
      Powered by <a href="https://quicko.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quicko</a>
    </p>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React/JSX">
    ```jsx
    <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px', color: '#666', marginTop: '16px' }}>

    width="100%"
    height="500"
    frameborder="0"

    // Add below your tool view
    let attributionLabel = UILabel()
    attributionLabel.text = "Powered by Quicko"
    attributionLabel.textAlignment = .center
    attributionLabel.font = .systemFont(ofSize: 14)
    attributionLabel.textColor = .gray
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Android (Kotlin)">
    ```kotlin
    // Add below your tool view in XML or programmatically
    TextView(context).apply {
        text = "Powered by Quicko"
        textAlignment = View.TEXT_ALIGNMENT_CENTER
        textSize = 14f
