The HRA (House Rent Allowance) Calculator helps employees determine the tax-exempt portion of their HRA, enabling them to optimize their tax savings legally.

## What is HRA Exemption?

HRA exemption is a tax benefit available to salaried individuals who receive House Rent Allowance as part of their salary and pay rent for their accommodation. The exemption amount is the **minimum** of:

1. Actual HRA received
2. Rent paid minus 10% of basic salary
3. 50% of basic salary (metro cities) or 40% (non-metro cities)

<Accordion title="HRA Exemption Formula" icon="function-square" defaultOpen>
  ```
  Exempt HRA = MIN(
    Actual HRA received,
    Rent paid - 10% of Basic Salary,
    50% of Basic Salary (metro) OR 40% of Basic Salary (non-metro)
  )
  ```
