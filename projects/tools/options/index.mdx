Quicko Tools support customization to match your platform's branding. You pass an `theme` object that contains theme configuration to generate a complete color scheme.

## Structure

The `theme` object contains the following properties:

```json
"theme": {
  "mode": "light",
  "seed": "#2962FF"
}
```

| Property | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `$.theme.mode` | Theme mode (`light` or `dark`) | `light` |
| `$.theme.seed` | Seed color for theme generation (hex with `#`) | `#2962FF` |

## Theme Mode

Control whether the tool displays in light or dark mode:

  <Card title="Light Mode" icon="sun">
    Clean, bright interface suitable for light-themed applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dark Mode" icon="moon">
    Dark interface that reduces eye strain and suits dark-themed applications.
  </Card>
</Columns>

  <Tab title="Web (JSON)">
    ```json
"theme": {
      "mode": "dark"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="iOS (Map)">
    ```swift
    let theme: [String: Any] = [
        "mode": "dark"
    ]
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Android (JSONObject)">
    ```kotlin
    val theme = JSONObject().apply {
        put("mode", "dark")
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Seed Color

Provide a seed color and Quicko Tools will generate a complete color scheme. This ensures harmonious colors across the entire tool interface.

    ```json
"theme": {
      "mode": "light",
      "seed": "#2962FF"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="iOS (Map)">
    ```swift
    let theme: [String: Any] = [
        "mode": "light",
        "seed": "#2962FF"
    ]
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Android (JSONObject)">
    ```kotlin
    val theme = JSONObject().apply {
        put("mode", "light")
        put("seed", "#2962FF")
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Your Brand's Primary Color" icon="palette" defaultOpen>
    Pass your brand's primary color as the seed. It will generate complementary colors automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Respect User Preferences" icon="user-check">
    Detect the user's system theme preference and set the mode accordingly for a consistent experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Both Modes" icon="sun-moon">
    Always test your integration in both light and dark modes to ensure readability and visual appeal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid Low-Contrast Colors" icon="eye">
    Choose seed colors with sufficient contrast. Very light or very dark colors may produce themes with accessibility issues.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Themes

Here are some example seed color configurations:

| Brand Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Quicko Blue | `#2962FF` | Default Quicko branding |
| Forest Green | `#2E7D32` | Eco-friendly or financial apps |
