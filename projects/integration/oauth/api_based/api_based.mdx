API-based OAuth workflow that allows access without any redirection.

## API Based Workflow

The API-based workflow is a two-step process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate OTP">
    Generate OTP for users using the Generate OTP endpoint. Users will obtain a One Time Password (OTP) on their registered email address with a validity of 10 minutes.

    | HTTP Method | Resource                                                   | Description                                             |
    | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    | GET         | `{{your_oauth_app_authenticate}}/otp?username={username}` | API accepts username and sends OTP to registered email. |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify OTP">
    Provide the OTP and username (user's email) to verify the OTP. Obtain the `access_token` and use that with all subsequent requests.

    | HTTP Method | Resource                                                   | Description                                             |
    | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    | POST        | `{{your_oauth_app_authenticate}}/otp`                     | API verifies the OTP and returns the access token.      |
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2

After obtaining the `access_token`, use it for all subsequent requests to access protected resources.

### Additional Information

- The OTP is valid for 10 minutes.
- Ensure to handle errors appropriately, such as invalid OTP or expired OTP.
