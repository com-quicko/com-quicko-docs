It allows this access without any exposure of resource owner's credentials.

## API Based Workflow

The API-based workflow is a two step process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate OTP">
    Generate OTP for users using Generate OTP endpoints. User will obtain a One Time Password (OTP) on their registered email address with a validity of 10 mins.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify OTP">
    Provide the OTP and username (user's email) to Verify OTP endpoint. Obtain the `access_token` and use that with all subsequent requests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 1

Generate OTP for users using Generate OTP endpoints. User will obtain a One Time Password (OTP) on their registered email address with a validity of 10 mins.

| HTTP Method | Resource                                                   | Description                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET         | See code block below                                        | API accepts username and sends OTP to registered email. |

```
{{your_oauth_app_authenticate}}/otp?username={username}
```

### Step 2

Provide the OTP and username (user's email) to Verify OTP endpoint. Obtain the `access_token` and use that with all subsequent requests.

| HTTP Method | Resource                                                             | Description                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST        | See code block below                                                 | API accepts username and OTP to obtain resource owner's access_token. |

```
{{your_oauth_app_authenticate}}/otp?username={username}&otp={otp}
```
