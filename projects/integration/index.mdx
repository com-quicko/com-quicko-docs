# Overview

The **Quicko Integration Documentation** helps you integrate your application with Quicko to securely access user, financial, payroll, and banking data.  
This section covers authentication flows and multiple integration categories that power tax, finance, and reporting use cases.

All APIs are consent-driven and designed to be used after successful authentication.

## Authentication & OAuth

All Quicko integrations begin with authentication. This section explains how to obtain access tokens and user consent using OAuth.

Supported flows include:

- **Redirection-based OAuth** — Redirect users to Quicko for authorization and consent.
- **API-based OAuth** — Handle authentication programmatically using APIs.

Once generated, access tokens are used across all Integration APIs.
