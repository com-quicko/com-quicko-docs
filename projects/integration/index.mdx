# Quicko Integration — Overview

The **Quicko Integration Documentation** is intended for partners and platforms that want to **extend their offerings by integrating with Quicko** and **sending relevant data to Quicko for compliance and regulatory workflows**.

These integrations enable external systems—such as brokers, payroll providers, and banks—to push structured data into Quicko so it can be used for tax computation, reporting, and statutory compliance.

## Integration flow

The following steps outline the typical process for integrating your system with Quicko, regardless of whether you are a bank, broker, HRMS provider, or another platform.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand integration requirements">
    Identify the nature of your integration (for example, bank, broker, or HRMS) and review the data requirements defined in the relevant integration section.  
    This helps determine the APIs, payload structures, and compliance data expected by Quicko.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement APIs as per Quicko specifications">
    Build the required APIs and data pipelines based on the integration documentation.  
    Ensure request formats, authentication mechanisms, and validations match the specifications provided.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share endpoints and credentials">
    Provide the implemented API endpoints and required credentials to the Quicko team so the integration can be configured and reviewed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the integration">
    Validate data exchange in the testing environment to ensure accuracy, completeness, and compliance with expected workflows.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go live">
    Once testing is complete and approved, move the integration to production and begin submitting live data to Quicko.
  </Step>
</Steps>
