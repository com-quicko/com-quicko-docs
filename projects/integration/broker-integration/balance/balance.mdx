## Overview

The Balance API should return the trading account balance information for a user's account on a specific date. This is essential for Quicko to accurately compute taxes and prepare financial reports based on account balances as of a particular date (e.g., year-end, month-end, or any regulatory date).

## Query Parameters

Your API should accept a `date` query parameter to retrieve balance information for that specific date. This allows Quicko to fetch historical balance data when needed for compliance and tax computation purposes.

```
GET /user/balance?date=YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Response

Your Balance API should return the following balance information:
