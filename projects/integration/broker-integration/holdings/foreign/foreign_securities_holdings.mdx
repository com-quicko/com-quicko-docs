## Overview

The Foreign Securities Holdings API provides a snapshot of all foreign securities currently held by a user on a specific date. This includes foreign stocks, depository receipts, mutual funds, and ETFs. Foreign holdings data is critical for Quicko to understand international portfolio composition, calculate capital gains/losses in foreign currencies, and prepare accurate tax reports for international investments.

## Query Parameters

Your API should accept an `as_on_date` query parameter to retrieve holdings for a specific date. This allows Quicko to fetch historical holdings snapshots when needed for tax compliance and regulatory reporting on foreign investments.

```
GET /securities/foreign/holdings?as_on_date=YYYY-MM-DD
