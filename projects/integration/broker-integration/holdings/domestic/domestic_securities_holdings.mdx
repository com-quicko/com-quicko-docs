## Overview

The Domestic Securities Holdings API provides a snapshot of all securities currently held by a user on a specific date. This includes equities, mutual funds, and ETFs. Holdings data is critical for Quicko to understand the user's portfolio composition, calculate capital gains/losses, and prepare accurate tax reports.

## Query Parameters

Your API should accept an `as_on_date` query parameter to retrieve holdings for a specific date. This allows Quicko to fetch historical holdings snapshots when needed for tax compliance and regulatory reporting.

```
GET /securities/domestic/holdings?as_on_date=YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Response Format

Your API should return holdings data organized by three categories:
