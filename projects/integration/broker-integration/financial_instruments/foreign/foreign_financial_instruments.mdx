## Overview

The Foreign Financial Instruments API provides reference data for foreign securities held in user accounts. This data includes current market prices (closing values) which are essential for Quicko to calculate unrealized P&L (Profit & Loss) on foreign holdings that have not been sold yet.

When users hold foreign stocks, depository receipts, mutual funds, or ETFs, we need up-to-date pricing information to accurately compute:
- Unrealized gains/losses on active foreign positions
- Portfolio valuations in foreign currencies
- Tax compliance reporting based on foreign investment holdings
- Tax gain/loss harvesting opportunities on international securities

## Response Format

Your API should return financial instrument reference data organized by four categories:
