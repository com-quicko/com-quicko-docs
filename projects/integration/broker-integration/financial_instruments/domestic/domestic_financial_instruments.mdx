## Overview

The Domestic Financial Instruments API provides reference data for securities held in user accounts. This data includes current market prices (last traded prices) which are essential for Quicko to calculate unrealized P&L (Profit & Loss) on holdings that have not been sold yet.

When users hold securities, mutual funds, or derivatives, we need up-to-date pricing information to accurately compute:
- Unrealized gains/losses on active positions
- Portfolio valuations
- Tax compliance reporting based on current market values
- Tax gain/loss harvesting opportunities

## Response Format

Your API should return financial instrument reference data organized by three categories:
