## Overview

The Open Positions API provides information about all currently open derivative positions held by a user on a specific date. Open positions represent active futures and options contracts that have not yet been closed. This data is essential for Quicko to:
- Calculate unrealized P&L on active derivative positions
- Monitor margin requirements and risk exposure
- Prepare accurate profit/loss statements for tax compliance
- Track derivative holdings for regulatory reporting

## Query Parameters

Your API should accept an `as_on_date` query parameter to retrieve open positions for a specific date. This allows Quicko to fetch historical snapshots of derivative positions when needed for tax and compliance purposes.

```
GET /open-positions?as_on_date=YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Response Format

Your API should return open positions data organized by derivative category:
