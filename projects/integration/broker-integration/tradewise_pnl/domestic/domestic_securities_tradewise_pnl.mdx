- Generate accurate P&L statements for tax compliance
- Provide trade-by-trade cost basis and expense tracking
- Track specific cost identification for matched buy-sell pairs

## Query Parameters

Your API should accept `from` and `to` query parameters to retrieve P&L data for a specific date range.

```
GET /securities/domestic/tradewise-pnl?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Response Format

Your API should return matched trade pairs with complete P&L calculations organized by security type:
